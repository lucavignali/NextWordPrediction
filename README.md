# Next Word Prediction
A basic implementation of NLP to predict the Next Word in a Sentence.

The description of te developed Shiny App, is available [here](https://rpubs.com/lvignali/170990), while the Shiny App it self is [here](https://rpubs.com/lvignali/170990).

__Do you want to have (moderate) fun with this App?__

When I tested this App, I started writing simple common sentences start like “I want”, “I am”, “I think”, “My Mother”, pushed Predict Next Word to obtain the prediction.
Then I added the predicted word to the Text Input and pushed again the Predict Next Word and so on. 

For example start with:

1. “I think”, push predict and obtain “I”

2. Add “I” in the Text input, so that the new sentence is “I think I” and predict again, obtain “am”.

3. Add “am” in the Text input. Now you have “I think I am”. Predict the next word and repeat the same process again and again.
If you repeat the process a number of times, you can obtain a sentence that you can imagine being generated by the guy called Algorithm and start to be familiar with him/her, start to know what he/she likes, thinks….

Of course this is just a joke to have “moderate” fun with this App.
Enjoy it!
