### How to use this Shiny App

To use this simple Shiny App, just type your sentence in the Text Input, press "Predict Next Word" button and wait typically few seconds.

As the algorithm is a bit heavier in the case of "common" words, expect to wait longer time to predict the word following a common one.
The output appears below the title "Prediction" and once it appears you can try a new sentence. Note that the second time you use it, you have a better perception that you have actually pushed the Predict Next Word button, as the previously predicted word is grayed out.
