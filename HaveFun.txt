### Do you want to have (moderate) fun with this App?

When I tested this App, I started writing simple common sentences start like "I want", "I am", "I think", "My Mother", pushed Predict Next Word to obtain the prediction.
Then I added the predicted word to the Text Input and pushed again the Predict Next Word and so on. 

For example start with:

* "I think", push predict and obtain "I"
* Add "I" in the Text input, so that the new sentence is "I think I" and predict again, obtain "am".
* Add "am" in the Text input. Now you have "I think I am". Predict the next word and repeat the same process again and again.

If you repeat the process a number of times, you can obtain a sentence that you can imagine being generated by the guy called Algorithm and start to be familiar with him/her, start to know what he/she likes, thinks....

Of course this is just a joke to have "moderate" fun with this App.

Enjoy it!
